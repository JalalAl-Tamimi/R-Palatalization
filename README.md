# R-Palatalization

This repository contains all of our code used in the upcoming paper **Ulrich, N., & Al-Tamimi, J. (Under review). An acoustic investigation into the palatalization contrast in Russian fricatives. *The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America (JASA)*.**

The notebooks reflect the following:

1. The Random Forests codes for the three comparisons: a) All sounds, 2) palatalized vs non-palatalized and 3) by place (and voicing)
2. GAMMs codes for dynamic measures of the top six acoustic predictors identified as the most predictive
